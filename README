Q4M - a Message Queue for MySQL

http://q4m.github.io/

Q4M is a message queue that works as a pluggable storage engine of MySQL
5.1 / 5.5 / 5.6.

* MySQL 5.6 Compatibility

As of MySQL 5.6, it is no longer possible to call the `queue_wait()`
function within a `WHERE` clause, due to a change within the internals
of MySQL core.

In case it is necessary to use the feature, you should apply
`support-files/5.6-select-where-queue-wait.patch` to the MySQL source
code, disable the assertion code at the top of `queue_wait_init`
function in `src/ha_queue.cc`, and recompile both MySQL and Q4M.

The patch is not necessary if you are always calling the function in a
separate statement (e.g. `SELECT queue_wait()`).
