Q4M is a message queue that works as a pluggable storage engine of MySQL
5.1.

Since its development is still in very early alpha-stage, NEVER USE THE
SOFTWARE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.


* LICENSE and COPYRIGHT

Please refer to each file.  The engine was built from the Skeleton engine
and the copyright of the build scripts mostly belong to their authors.
Copyright of the source code of the queue engine belongs to Cybozu Labs,
Inc., and is licensed under GPLv2.


* LIMITATIONS

- table contents are not saved onto disk
  - wait for updates
- no indexes support
  - simplicity for speed
  - is it neressary, when we can create any number of tables=queues?


* INSTALLATION

To install the software, follow the steps below.

 % ./configure --with-mysql=<mysql-source-dir> --libdir=<mysql-lib-dir>
 % make
 % make install
 % mysql -u root
 > INSTALL PLUGIN queue SONAME 'libqueue_engine.so';
 > CREATE FUNCTION queue_wait RETURN INT SONAME 'libqueue_engine.so';
 > CREATE FUNCTION queue_end RETURN INT SONAME 'libqueue_engine.so';
 > CREATE FUNCTION queue_abort RETURN INT SONAME 'libqueue_engine.so';

If you are installing Q4M against a debug build of MySQL, it might be
necessary to set the -DSAFE_MUTEX compile option.

 % CFLAGS=-DSAFE_MUTEX CXXFLAGS=-DSAFE_MUTEX ./configure ...


* USAGE

creating queues:
 > CREATE TABLE my_queue (id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL) ENGINE=queue;

sending messages to queue:
 > INSERT INTO my_queue (id) values (2),(3),(4);

receiving messages from queue (shown in perl code):
  
  while (1) {
    # wait until any data becomes available
    $dbh->do('select queue_wait("dbname.tblname")');
    # receive data (only one row becomes ready at once)
    if (my @ary = $dbh->selectrow_array('select * from tblname')) {
      # process data
      unless (process_row(@ary)) {
        # abort if failed, return data to queue
        $dbh->do('select queue_abort()');
        last;
      }
    }
  }
  # tidy up
  $dbh->do('select queue_end()');
